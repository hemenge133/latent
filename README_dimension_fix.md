# Model Dimension Fix for Resuming Training

## Issue Description
When resuming training from a checkpoint, if the model dimensions (particularly `d_model`) specified in the command-line arguments didn't match the dimensions in the checkpoint, the code would fail with an error message:

```
ERROR: Model dimension mismatch! Checkpoint has d_model=768, but current model uses d_model=64
Please use --d-model 768 when resuming from this checkpoint
```

This required users to manually specify the correct dimensions when resuming training, which was error-prone and inconvenient.

## Fix Applied
The fix modifies the resume process to:

1. Check the checkpoint files **before** creating the models
2. Extract the model dimensions from the checkpoint (`d_model`, `num_layers`, `num_latent`, etc.)
3. Automatically update the command-line arguments to match the checkpoint dimensions
4. Create the models with the updated dimensions
5. Continue with loading the state dictionaries from the checkpoints

This ensures that the model architecture always matches the checkpoint when resuming training, regardless of what was specified in the command-line arguments.

## Implementation Details
The main changes were:

1. Moving the checkpoint loading code before model creation
2. Extracting model dimensions from both the checkpoint config and model state
3. Updating the arguments with the checkpoint's dimensions
4. Reorganizing the code to avoid duplicate checkpoint loading

## Testing
A test script (`scripts/test_dimension_fix.sh`) was created to verify the fix:

1. It first trains a model with `d_model=32`
2. Then tries to resume training with `d_model=64` (intentionally different)
3. The fix automatically detects that the checkpoint has `d_model=32`
4. It adjusts the value and successfully continues training with the correct dimension

The test log shows:
```
Found d_model=32 in checkpoint config
Updating d_model from 64 to 32 to match checkpoint
```

## Benefits
- Users no longer need to remember or specify the exact dimensions when resuming training
- Resuming works automatically even with different command-line arguments
- Reduces errors and improves user experience
- Makes experimentation and training continuation more seamless
